# Introduction

Use stylometry to decide author of a given book.
First time you run the project, all authors from Project Gutenberg will be scraped? Then _n_ authors are selected and their corpus is downloaded. A few books are extracted from the corpus to use for validation. Then the algorithms perform their magic on the remaining corups, using these steps:

1. Hej
2. Hej hej

Source for raw text books is [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
